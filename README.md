# Spambot

Simple spambot made by meTju in python. Gimme a star on github: https://github.com/I-meTju-I

## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install requirements before starting script.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Have all your files in one folder for all functions to work properly. 

## Usage

When you choose the spam option, an 8-second timer starts. Move your cursor to the appropriate chat box. Bot uses random time intervals so it's harder to detect it. Quit spamming anytime by holding the 'ESC' key. **Beware** that it will spam at your cursor location, so keep it in chat box before quiting.
### **Mention spam**

Spam anyone on Discord with @name, @everyone, @here... Use bigger interval between spams, so Discord wont detect spambot. Around 0.1 second is best.

### **Message spam**

Spam anyone anywhere with this message. 

### **File spam**
Spam anyone with your message in **message.txt** file. File needs to be in the same folder as script.

### **Settings**
Configure your own spam intervals. Default interval is set to 0.1 . When you set interval to 0, spam will be instant. **Instant spam is easier to detect so use with caution.**
